# EXAMPLE 

For here, an example of config file in JSON form:

```json
{ "port" : 3000
, "database" :
  { "hostaddr" :"localhost"
  , "database" :"dev10"
  , "access-mode":"master"
  , "username":"dev10"
  , "password":"dev10"
  , "pool-stripes":10
  , "pool-kept-time":100
  , "pool-strp-max":10
  }
, "title" : "Glob SSSTA"
, "password-environment-variable" :"GLOB_PSK"
, "log-path" :"stdout"
, "listen-type":"*"
}
```
And we suppose that file is named "config.json".
The command to run this one is:
```shell
glob-launch -f config.json
```
or
```shell
cat config.json | glob-launch
```
.

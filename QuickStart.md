This post is about "Quick".If you want to use Glob,
read this post first.

# With Docker

Pull the docker image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com),
and write config file and Makefile and upload the site.

## Pull
If you hosted docker container on your own computer,
just run `docker pull qinka/glob:TAGS` to pull the image.
If you are using a CaaS (Container as a Server),
you just need search the 'qinka/glob', and deploy it.

For tags, the ones named glob-0.0.10-* are corresponding to
this post. And the ones without git commit info are same to "latest" of 0.0.10.x.

Usually, the something are need before you launch the glob.
